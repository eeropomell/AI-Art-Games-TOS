# Privacy Policy
The use of this application ("AI Art Games") in a server requires the collection of some specific user data ("Data"). The Data collected includes, but is not limited to Discord user ID, channel ID and guild ID values. Use of the AI Art Games is considered an agreement to the terms of this Policy. 

## Collection and usage of Data

The following outlines the data collection and its utilization:

- UserIds, usernames, guildIds, and guild names are stored to record user scores in the /ai-or-not and /guess-the-prompt guessing games. This data is essential for the functionality of the /leaderboard command.

- User choices in the /ai-or-not game are stored upon making a guess. This information serves as quantitative data for analyzing user perceptions of AI-generated versus real photos, thereby enhancing the image set for the /ai-or-not game.

- The value of the `story` parameter provided by the user when generating a comic via the /comic-strip command is stored. This data aids in identifying users who are misusing the AI Art Games, such as by generating NSFW comics.
