# AI Art Games Terms of Service

AI Art Games bot (the "Developers", "us", "we", or "our") operates the  the AI Art Games Discord application. For the duration of these terms, our services may be referred to as the "Service" or the "bot".

# Terms

By accessing or using the service, you agree to be bound to the terms of service, all applicable laws, regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws of the place where the owner is based. If you do not acknowledge and agree to these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing the service.

The Service may only be used within the scope of what it is provided for, under these Terms and applicable law. Users are solely responsible for making sure that their use of the Service violates no law, regulations, or third-party rights. Therefore, we reserve the right to take any appropriate measure to protect legitimate interests of the Service including denying Users access to the Service or reporting any misconduct preformed through the Service to applicable authorities at our sole discretion.

# Prohibited Content 

The creation of NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content using the "/comic-strip" command is strictly prohibited. Users found violating this policy may be subject to immediate removal from the Service.

# Limitations

In no event shall we be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on the Service, even if us or a AI Art Games Bot authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

# Modifications

We may revise these terms of service or our [privacy policy](https://github.com/eeropomell/AI-Art-Games-TOS/blob/main/privacy.md) for the Service at any time without notice. By using the Service you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these terms of service and privacy policy.
